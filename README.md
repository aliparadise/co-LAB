# co-LAB
<b style="font-size: 20px;"><i>Artists and Makers...Unite!</i></b> ðŸŽ¨

<b style="font-size: 25px;">Application Overview</b>

co-LAB is an application that allows artists (Collaborators) to create their own art studio meet-ups (LABs). A LAB provides artists with an opportunity for group creativity, social time and collaboration. A Collaborator can also select a Facilitator to be present at their LAB, to ensure art time runs smoothly. 

This application was built in a week, and I used React and CSS for styling. My main goal for this project was to demonstrate basic CRUD functionality, and then improve upon the application with clean styling and added features.
